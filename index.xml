I returned with my wife in 1989, knowing that Birmingham is a great place to raise a family. I worked as an anesthesiologist until retiring in 2019.
I was a child of the Space Race era, and became interested in astronomy and astrophotography at a young age. I bought my first “real” telescope at age 13, after saving my earnings from neighborhood lawn-mowing services.</description></item><item><title>Mission &amp; Scope</title><link>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/mission/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/mission/</guid><description>Mission Our mission is to promote appreciation and conservation of starry skies across the southeastern United States.
In April 2022, Dr. Michelle Wooten, an International Dark-Sky Association Delegate in Alabama, invited the astronomy clubs of Alabama to meet together to form a dark-sky advocacy collective. Over the next few months we (i) applied to become an International Dark-Sky Association chapter, (ii) voted to change our state-based focused to a regional focus spanning the southeastern United States without an IDA chapter, and (iii) voted on our collective&amp;rsquo;s name, Starry Skies South.</description></item><item><title>Our Region</title><link>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/region/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/region/</guid><description>Our proposed region includes Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.</description></item><item><title>Partner Organizations</title><link>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/partners/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/partners/</guid><description>Learn about the groups with whom we are partnered.</description></item><item><title>Acknowledgements</title><link>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/acknowledgements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/acknowledgements/</guid><description>Learn about the people and organizations that have supported us.
