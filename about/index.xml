Mission Our mission is to promote appreciation and preservation of starry skies across the southeastern United States.
Background &amp;amp; Scope In April 2022, Dr. Michelle Wooten, an International Dark-Sky Association Delegate in Alabama, invited the astronomy clubs of Alabama to meet together to form a dark-sky advocacy collective. Over the next few months we (i) applied to become an International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) chapter, (ii) voted to change our state-based focused to a regional focus spanning the Southeastern United States without an IDA chapter, and (iii) voted on our collective&amp;rsquo;s name, Starry Skies South.</description></item><item><title>Our Region</title><link>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/region/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/region/</guid><description>Our region includes Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina*, and South Carolina. We welcome participants from other places across the southeastern United States, per their interest. To participate, membership to DarkSky International is recommended but not required.
*ï»¿North Carolina also has a state-based chapter, DarkSky North Carolina. Some members in DarkSky NC also participate in Starry Skies South.</description></item><item><title>Partner Organizations</title><link>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/partners/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/partners/</guid><description>Learn about the groups with whom we are partnered.</description></item><item><title>Members in the News</title><link>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/members-in-the-news/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.starryskiessouth.org/about/members-in-the-news/</guid><description>The above image was taken by Georgia member, Meaghan Gerard Walsh.
