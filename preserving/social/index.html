Take a moment to take in the splendor of the night sky when it is seen without the effect of misdirected artificial light at night:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KySThq5CxLI title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3 id=p><p></h3><h3 id=energy-waste>Energy Waste</h3><p>Humans spend several billions of dollars annually on misdirected artificial light at night. This amounts to over 20 millions of tons of wasted carbon dioxide. By using lighting that promotes starry skies (also called dark-sky friendly lighting), we can save ourselves and our community&rsquo;s money. The below infographic details how lighting contributes to energy waste. Learn more <a href=https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/energy-waste/>here</a>.</p><p><img src=/images/uploads/energy-waste-web-1-647x500.jpg alt></p><h3 id=safety>Safety</h3><p>Misdirected light at night, <em>glare</em> from unshielded lights, makes it harder to see at night. By choosing fully-shielded, targeted lighting, it is easier to see your surroundings.</p><p>Consider how much easier it is to see someone - a potential intruder - when a glaring light is shielded by your hand.</p><p><img src=/images/uploads/shielded.png alt></p><p><em>The above photo series was captured by George Fleenor.</em></p><h3 id=neighborly-lighting>Neighborly Lighting</h3><p>Are you troubled sleeping at night due to your neighbor&rsquo;s or city&rsquo;s light pouring through your window? This light is negatively affecting your health and potentially others&rsquo; too.</p><p>Many cities and counties have lighting ordinances in place requiring shielded light and/or lighting that does not trespass into homes. However, many times, individuals are unaware of how their lighting is affecting others. You can typically find your county&rsquo;s lighting ordinance via a web engine search that includes your county name, your state name, and the phrase &ldquo;zoning regulation.&rdquo; Once you find your city and county&rsquo;s lighting ordinance, you can bring the light trespass you are experiencing to your local police or legislators and encourage new fixture implementation.</p><p>Meanwhile, consider how your own home lighting might be creating light trespass onto your neighbor&rsquo;s property. Follow the guidelines <a href=https://www.darksky.org/dark-sky-friendly-home-lighting-program/>provided on this website</a> to consider how you might change your lighting to eliminate light trespass. Once your lighting is improved, you can print out a <em>Dark Sky Friendly Home</em> certificate.</p><p>To support safety, our heritage of starry skies, reduced energy waste, and neighborly lighting, choose fully-shielded fixtures for your home and community - <em>put a shield on it.</em></p><p><img src=/images/uploads/glare.jpg alt></p></article></div></div><div class="col-4 col-12-narrower"><div id=sidebar><section><h2>Preserve Starry Skies</h2><ul class=links><li><a href=/preserving/lighting/>Lighting for Starry Skies</a></li><li><a href=/preserving/environment/>Environmental Benefits</a></li><li class=active><a href=/preserving/social/>Social Benefits</a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div></section><div id=footer><ul class=icons><li><a href=https://www.twitter.com/starryskysouth class="icon brands fa-twitter"><span class=label>Twitter</span></a><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/1012753086040435 class="icon brands fa-facebook-f"><span class=label>Facebook</span></a></ul><div class=copyright><ul class=menu><li>Â© Starry Skies South.
