### Mission

Our mission is to promote appreciation and preservation of starry skies across the southeastern United States.

### Background & Scope

In April 2022, Dr. Michelle Wooten, an International Dark-Sky Association Delegate in Alabama, invited the [astronomy clubs of Alabama](https://www.go-astronomy.com/astro-clubs-state.php?State=AL) to meet together to form a dark-sky advocacy collective.  Over the next few months we (i) applied to become an International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) chapter, (ii) voted to change our state-based focused to a regional focus spanning the Southeastern United States without an IDA chapter, and (iii) voted on our collective's name, *Starry Skies South.*  In June 2022, members of Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina joined our monthly meeting for the first time. In August 2022, the IDA approved our application as an official regional Chapter of their organization.  In May 2023, North Carolina joined our regional purview.  North Carolina also has their own state chapter, and people from North Carolina are welcome to be a part of both chapters.  

We are currently in the process of increasing our membership from interested partner organizations across the southeast, preparing our nonprofit application paperwork, and developing our city- and state-based initiatives.  These initiatives include public education about the importance of preserving starry skies, creation of dark sky places, and lobbying.

Our meetings take place virtually on the third Thursday of every month at 7 p.m. Central (8 p.m.  Eastern).  If you would like to join us, please contact us at info@starryskiessouth.org.
