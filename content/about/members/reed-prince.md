I got into the dark sky movement through my interest in joining the Birmingham Astronomical Society. My first contact with BAS was Michelle Wooten, the Alabama Delegate for the International Dark Sky Association. I had noticed for some time that the stars were becoming more and more invisible. I just did not realize how bad the situation was until I took a good look at the IDSA educational materials.

I am working on...

* Spreading the work regarding the impact of poor lighting on our ability to fully enjoy the night sky.
* Looking for dark sky parks nearby
* Working with local legislators on keeping Shelby County skies dark
