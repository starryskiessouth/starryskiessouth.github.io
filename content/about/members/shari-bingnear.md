Growing up in Wyoming, I always loved nature and a brilliant star filled night sky. Throughout the years I've traveled to many national parks, like Bryce Canyon, where I learned about DarkSky International and their mission to preserve the dark. Now I live in the north Georgia mountains where we still have a beautiful night sky, and I don't want to see it disappear. I have found an opportunity through my work at the Fannin County Chamber of Commerce to help educate people, both residents and visitors, about light pollution and how they can help save our precious fireflies and the night sky for generations to come.
