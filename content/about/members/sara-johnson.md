I became interested in dark sky advocacy primarily as a birder, and my concern for migrating birds through our lit and altered landscape. Through my work at the Champaign County Audubon Society, I began working with local organizations to begin a regional dark sky week and "Lights Out for Migration" campaign. I think that light pollution is a serious but overlooked problem, as we, as humans, have trouble noticing small and gradual change. As we grow as a region here in the Southeast, this is a major problem that we still have time to ameliorate. I also am hopeful that solving the light pollution problem is as easy as flipping a switch. It's advocating others to your cause that is our challenge and my goal.
