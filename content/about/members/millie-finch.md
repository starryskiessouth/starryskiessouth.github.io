I am deeply passionate about preserving dark skies and reducing light pollution for the benefit of both humans and the natural world. I recognize that the artificial lighting that permeates our cities and suburbs not only obscures our view of the stars, but also disrupts the circadian rhythms of humans and animals, affecting their health and behavior. I understand that light pollution can have negative impacts on ecosystems, particularly nocturnal animals and insects, and disrupts the balance of the natural world. I also believe that preserving dark skies has cultural and spiritual importance, connecting us to our heritage and inspiring wonder and awe. Through my advocacy, I aim to raise awareness about the importance of reducing light pollution, promote sustainable lighting practices, and work towards policies that protect and preserve our natural darkness. I believe that by preserving dark skies, we can improve the health and well-being of all living creatures, and ensure that future generations can experience the beauty and wonder of the natural world at night
