I have been involved in astronomy ever since I was a child, volunteering with the Von Braun Astronomical Society (VBAS) on Monte Sano Mountain in Huntsville, Alabama. I found that in showing others how to find things in the night sky, as well as educating them on the damage we are doing to the night's beauty. The skies have gotten steadily worse in Huntsville overall as the city expands, so too do the lights. I've lived here my whole life, and been involved in astronomy for over half of it now. Fast forward fifteen years and now I am currently the President of VBAS, helping Starry Skies South to assist them however we can!
