I have selfish reasons to keep my skies as natural as possible. I learned in Astronomy Class at UAB my family deals with light trespass from a neighboring park. I have a small child, and itâ€™s proven hard to trick her into thinking it was nighttime when floodlights are shining in her room. This class inspired me to create positive change in my community. I have joined Starry Skies South in my area, and I encourage others to advocate for their areas as well. My goal is to contact our civic officials, and to get on a path of understanding about how natural skies affect people, plants, animals, everything! Please contact me if you are of the same mind and you need help in your community. Together I hope we can create a platform with our officials to educate and advocate not only the southeast, but everywhere that has a sky.
