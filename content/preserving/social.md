### The Heritage of Starry Skies

Starry skies have benefitted Earthen creatures - both health-wise and aesthetically - for centuries.  Take a moment to take in the splendor of the night sky when it is seen without the effect of  misdirected artificial light at night:

### Energy Waste

Humans spend several billions of dollars annually on misdirected artificial light at night.  This amounts to over 20 millions of tons of wasted carbon dioxide.  The below infographic details this production.  Learn more [here](https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/energy-waste/).

### Safety

Misdirected light at night, *glare* from unshielded lights*,* makes it harder to see at night.  By choosing fully-shielded, targeted lighting, it is easier to see your surroundings.  

Consider how much easier it is to see someone - a potential intruder - when a glaring light is shielded by your hand.

To support safety and the heritage of dark skies, choose fully-shielded fixtures for your home and community - *put a shield on it.*
